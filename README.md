# NixOS config (WIP)

![](https://share.keks.club/-Cdbc5AoeLr/Screenshot%20from%202023-03-15%2014-38-06.png)

I am step by step building my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) config here.
Currently, the config is supposed to be run in a VM in Virtualbox.

Try this config by cloning the repo into `/etc/nixos/` and run a `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
